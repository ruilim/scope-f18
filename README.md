# Scope Fall 2018: Electron

This is the Scope Fall 2018 GitHub curriculum repository! Here you'll find projects and resources that will help you learn Electron throughout the semester. Here you'll find a folder for every lesson. Within each folder is a project and a README.md that will guide you step-by-step on how to build the project for that lesson.

### Curriculum Outline
* [**Lesson 1**](lesson-1): Introduction to Electron; Environment Setup
* [**Lesson 2**](lesson-2): Pomodoro Timer - Native Menu System
* [**Lesson 3**](lesson-3): Simple Soundboard - Filesystem API
* [**Lesson 4**](lesson-4): Markdown Editor - System Clipboard and Keyboard Shortcuts
* [**Lesson 5**](lesson-5): Cryptocurrency Tracker - Interprocess Communication and Windows Management
* [**Lesson 6**](lesson-6): App Deployment and Review

### Using This Repo
To use this repo properly, first follow [lesson 1](lesson-1/README.md) to get Git, Node, Electron, and the right environment setup on your machine.

For every lesson, there's a project and a `README.md` that corresponds to that project. The project will contain the full finished code for that lesson and the `README.md` will walk you step-by-step on how to build that week's project from scratch.

We hope you'll follow along our curriculum and get started building Web apps. It's going to be a fun semester and we're glad you're a part of it!
